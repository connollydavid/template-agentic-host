# Structure

An agentic project (e.g. `agentic-acme`) is the externalized *thought* about the
work; the software under development is the *action*, hosted beneath it. Its
rooms map to the five W's.

| W | room | holds |
|---|---|---|
| Who | `cast/` | personas (Powell, Keenan & McDaid 2007) — examples Mara + Wren |
| What | `plan/NNNN-*/spec/` | behavioural (`.allium`) + temporal (`.tla/`) specs |
| When | `plan/` | the milestone index and folders |
| Where | `<software>/` | the hosted software — a bare store with worktrees; you add it |
| Why | `call/` | decisions (MADR; see `call/0000`) |
| How | `CLAUDE.md` + `tools/` | the verification lanes |

`tools/` are referenced submodules, each under its own license — we orchestrate
and wrap, never patch:

- `tools/host-lint` (Unlicense) — hygiene / anti-slop; checks names against `host-grammar`.
- `tools/host-lifecycle` (Unlicense) — token-free scaffolder/validator; generates names from `host-grammar`, so what it emits is exactly what `host-lint` accepts.
- `tools/allium` (MIT, JUXT) — requirements + property-based testing.
- `tools/specula` (Apache-2.0) — timing and concurrency via TLA+.

(`host-grammar`, the shared naming/numbering rules crate, is a build dependency of `host-lint` and `host-lifecycle` — not a host submodule.)

`.claude/skills/` are symlinks into those submodules' skills — reference, not
copy. They are **generated, not tracked**: `link-skills.sh` creates a link for each
*materialized* tool (skipping uninitialized submodules), because a tracked symlink
into an uninitialized tool dangles and trips any tree-walking tool
(`call/0005`). Run it after `git submodule update --init`. Tool *outputs* are
project-owned (see `call/0001`).

The *Where* room is the software under test — **one or more** components, each
embedded as a **bare store with worktrees**: `<name>.git/` is the shared object
store, `<name>/` is the canonical worktree (the audited state, where CI runs), and
`<name>.<line>/` are parallel worktrees — one per agent or live release branch.
These trees are local and gitignored; the host commits a recipe (`.host-software`)
with **one `[software "<name>"]` stanza per component** (mirroring `.gitmodules`),
each recording the source URL, the pinned canonical SHA, and the worktree set,
which `host-lifecycle software --materialize` realises and `--check` audits
(`call/0004`). The recorded pin replaces a submodule gitlink as the
reproducibility anchor, so several branches stay materialized at once where a
single submodule tree could not.

To instantiate: clone, `git submodule update --init` (the tools), run
`./link-skills.sh` (regenerate the skill symlinks for the tools you initialized),
replace the `cast/` examples with your own personas, and set up your software as a
bare store with worktrees (above). To bring an *existing* repo under the
methodology instead, follow the `host` repo (`github.com/connollydavid/host`).

To publish docs with mdBook, run **`host-lifecycle book .`** — the canonical
publisher, so you do not hand-roll a generator that drops a room or re-derives the
src-scoping wrong. It writes a `book.toml` scoped to a generated `docs/` (never
`src = "."`, which would walk the tool submodules and the un-materialized software
worktree and trip over whatever is not present; `call/0005`) and a `SUMMARY.md` in
**lifecycle order**: Cast (Who) → Plan + specs (What/When) → Software/Where (a stub
read from `.host-software`) → Call (Why) → Reference/CLAUDE (How) → Memory. Then
`host-lifecycle book --check .` fails the build unless every room with source
renders a page, so a half-room site cannot ship. `book.toml` and `docs/` are
generated output (gitignored); the reference Site workflow under
`.github/workflows/` runs both before `mdbook build`.

A migrated or instantiated repo carries a `.host` stamp at its root
recording the template revision it adopted (`template`/`revision`/`adopted`),
written by `host-lifecycle adopt`. It is what a later upgrade diffs from. An
optional `name` line pins the published book's title, so `host-lifecycle book`
does not derive it from the checkout directory.

The methodology lives in `CLAUDE.md` — read it first. The whole template is
released into the public domain (Unlicense); see `README.md` for provenance.
