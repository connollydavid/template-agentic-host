# MIGRATION.md — bring an existing repo under the agentic-host methodology

This is the protocol for *adopting* the methodology into a repo that already
exists, and for *upgrading* a repo that adopted an earlier version. Follow it in
order. It is written to be literal: do each step, run the stated check, and stop
to ask the human at the points marked **(human)**.

Two things vary, independently:

- **Case** — what governance the repo already has (its starting state).
- **Mode** — how much you change, and whether history moves (the blast radius).

Pick the case first — it decides how you establish governance — then the mode,
which decides how you apply the audit.

## Cases

| Case | The repo has | You will |
|---|---|---|
| **a** | no `CLAUDE.md` | drop in the canonical manual and record the repo's own conventions |
| **b** | a `CLAUDE.md` that predates this methodology | **merge** its rules with the spine **(human)** |
| **c** | a `.host` stamp (it adopted an earlier revision) | **upgrade** by diffing template revisions |

`host-lifecycle classify <dir>` prints `a`, `b`, or `c` for you.

## Modes and how to choose

| Mode | What it touches | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Preview** | nothing (report only) | always — run it first |
| **Shallow PR** *(default)* | one branch/PR; live files only; history untouched | almost always |
| **Staged** | several PRs; live files only | the live changes are too large to review in one PR |
| **Deep rewrite** | history (archive-first, force-push) | only when history coherence is worth more than its provenance |

**Selection rule.** Default to **Shallow**. Go to **Staged** when the live diff is
too big to review in one sitting. Choose **Deep** *only* when rewriting history
buys coherence worth more than the disruption — and **never** on history that
carries provenance you do not control (an upstream patch series, tags others
have pulled). Deep always means: create and push a protected `archive/` branch
first, then rewrite, then force-push with lease.

History is **immutable by default**. In every mode except Deep, tells already in
the commit log are *acknowledged*, not rewritten.

## The stamp — `.host`

A repo records which template revision it adopted, at the repo root:

```
template = "https://github.com/connollydavid/host-template"
revision = "<sha-or-tag>"
adopted  = "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

`host-lifecycle adopt` writes it; `host-lifecycle version` reads it. The
`revision` is what a later case-(c) upgrade diffs from, so it must be exact.

## The protocol

### 0. Preview

- `host-lifecycle classify <dir>` → the case.
- `host-lint --all` → naming tells in **live tracked files** (you will fix these).
- `host-lint --log` → tells in **history** (informational; do not rewrite unless Deep).
- From the output, write down the **rename map** (each ordinal-named file →
  its content-named home under `plan/`) and, for case (b), the **merge plan**.
  Apply nothing yet.

### 1. Establish governance (by case)

- **(a)** Copy this template's `CLAUDE.md` in unchanged. Then find the repo's
  implicit conventions — its build, test, and style rules — by reading the code
  or asking the human, and record them under a project-specifics heading. Do not
  impose a rule that contradicts the repo's existing style.
- **(b) (human)** Merge. For each rule in the existing `CLAUDE.md`, decide:
  *subsumed* by the spine (drop it, note it in provenance), *project-specific*
  (keep it, move it under the project-specifics heading), or *conflicts* with the
  spine (stop, get a human ruling). Preserve any attribution or license the old
  file carried. The result is: the canonical spine + the kept specifics + a
  provenance note.
- **(c)** Upgrade. Read the stamp's `revision`; diff it against this template's
  current revision; re-apply the spine changes; leave the repo's project-specifics
  untouched. If tool submodules were renamed since, re-point them.

### 2. Scaffold the rooms

`host-lifecycle adopt <dir> <current-template-revision>` creates `cast/ plan/
call/` (idempotently — existing rooms are left alone) and writes the stamp. Add
your software as the hosted submodule under its own folder (the *Where* slot).

### 3. Wire the tools

Add the verification tools as submodules and symlink their skills:

```
tools/host-lint  tools/host-lifecycle  tools/allium  tools/specula
```

Install the host-lint git hooks (`pre-commit` and `commit-msg`) so new commits
are gated from here on.

### 4. Audit and apply, in the chosen mode

- **Live findings** (`host-lint --all`): fix them — rename each ordinal-named
  file to its content-named home under `plan/`, and update every reference.
  - *Shallow*: do it all in one PR.
  - *Staged*: split it — governance first, tooling next, the bulk renames last.
  - *Deep (human, opt-in)*: archive-first, then also rewrite history so blame and
    `log --follow` stay coherent; force-push with lease.
- **History findings** (`host-lint --log`): acknowledge them. Do not rewrite
  unless you are in Deep mode and the human opted in.

### 5. Stamp and record

The stamp is already written (when you scaffolded the rooms). Record a decision in `call/` — "adopted
template @ `<revision>`" (or "upgraded `<old>` → `<new>`") — and add a `MEMORY.md`
entry. These make the migration auditable from a fresh session.

### 6. Verify

- `host-lifecycle validate plan/` and `host-lifecycle validate call/` → `ok`.
- `host-lint --all` → clean on live files (or the remaining findings are the
  acknowledged baseline).
- Make a throwaway commit with a tell in its message → the hook blocks it.
- If the repo ships an mdBook site, it builds.

## Notes

- **Idempotent and resumable.** `adopt` skips rooms that exist; re-running the
  protocol is safe. If interrupted, re-run `classify` and continue.
- **Token-free where mechanical.** `host-lifecycle` does the scaffolding,
  numbering, and stamping; `host-lint` does the audit. Spend model effort only on
  the judgment in establishing governance (the case-(b) merge, eliciting
  case-(a) conventions) and the triage during the audit.
